Bug List and Fixes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not solved:

1 - Ambient Temperature changes after reset to current temperature;

2 - Cura "abort print" routine turns sends 0 to temperature target;

3 - PID autotuning routine times out at some temperatures (e.g 10ยบ and 30ยบ C);

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solved:

1 - When Cura turns off the heaters, the target of the peltier is zero; 
	Solution: Marlin sends PWM 0 to the peltier if target is 0 independent of current temperature;

2 - Cura turns the heater off after finishing the print;
	Solution: Cura ending routine was changed to not keep the heater on;
	
3 - Extruder don't work with new firmware;
	Solution: Setting MINIMUN_EXTRUDER_TEMPERATURE to 1ยบ C;

4 - Cura begins extrusion before reaching target;
	Solution: Automatic replacement of "M109 S" to "M109 R" in the post-processing generation of the G-code and adapting the M109 settings in the firmware (MIN_COOLING_SLOPE_DEG, MIN_COOLING_SLOPE_TIME,
	TEMP_HYSTERESIS and TEMP_WINDOW).

5 - If printer uses only cooling or only heating, the printer can be submitted to thermal runaway.
	Solution: If Peltier only cools, macro bypass the get_cool_or_heat() function and ambient temperature is ignored

Pending Tests:

1 - Thermal protection;

2 - Collagen bioprinting;

3 - Controller performance with and without autotuning;
